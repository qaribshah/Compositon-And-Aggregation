# Compositon-And-Aggregation
In this repo, I have created 3 classes named as Cstr, Date and Person.
Cstr is same as Cstring, which we will use as the char* to avoid the deepCopy. The Date class would consist of month number, name, day number, name and year. And the person class use Cstr type first name and last name of the person and Date Type date of birth.
